## Contribution Guidelines
### Make new branches, never commit directly to the main branch
In order to encourage collaboration without causing too much friction working in the same project as other developers
please checkout a new branch when making changes to the codebase.
* Give your branch a descriptive name
* Include your first name in the branch name
```commandline
git checkout -b aaron-update-readme
```
This way it will be clear to the other developers who each branch belongs to
and to avoid branch name collisions.

### Making Pull Requests
After you have made changes and would like to submit them
back into the project, please commit your changes to your branch
and open a pull request via the GitHub website
https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request

### Git resources
If you are unfamiliar with git and GitHub, I would highly recommend
referring to their documentation https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests. 
I would also recommend getting a tool to help, such as https://desktop.github.com/
and reviewing their documentation https://docs.github.com/en/desktop
